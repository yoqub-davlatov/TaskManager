# TaskManager

## Project Description: Streamlined Task Management App

Introducing a cutting-edge task management application designed to 
empower users in efficiently organizing their daily activities, projects, and to-do lists. 
With a sleek and intuitive user interface developed using Flutter for the front-end and 
Go for the server, the application offers a seamless experience for task creation, viewing, editing, and deletion.

## Key Features:

1. **Task Creation:** The app allows users to effortlessly create new tasks, enabling them to capture their ideas and responsibilities as they arise. The app offers an intuitive task entry form with fields for task title, description, due date, priority, and any additional notes.

2. **Task List View:** The app provides users with an organized and visually appealing list view of all their tasks. Tasks are conveniently sorted by due date and priority, aiding users in quickly identifying and focusing on the most pressing tasks.

3. **Effortless Editing:** It simplifies task management by allowing users to easily edit task details. Users can modify task titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities, and notes, ensuring their task list remains up-to-date and reflective of changing priorities.

4. **Streamlined Deletion:** Unnecessary tasks cluttering the user's to-do list can be deleted with just a few taps. Application ensures that users can swiftly remove tasks that are no longer relevant, contributing to a cleaner and more organized task list.

5. **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface of the application is designed for maximum ease of use. With an elegant design and intuitive navigation, users can quickly learn how to utilize the app's features, enhancing their overall experience.
